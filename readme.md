## Question and Answer

#### Q1. What is the difference between var, let, and const?

Answer : var is a function-scoped and can be redeclared or updated.
let is a block-scoped and can be updated but not redeclared at the same scope.
const is a block-scoped and cannot be updated or redeclared after being assigned.

#### Q2. What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()?

Answer : map() creates a new array by transforming each element.
forEach() creates simply runs a function on each element without running a new array.
filter() creates a new array with only the elements that pass a test.

#### Q3. What are arrow functions in ES6?

Answer : Arrow functions in ES6 are short way to write function using (=>). They are simpler and faster to type. They also handle "this" differently and normal function.

#### Q4. How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?

Answer : In ES6, destructuring lets us takes values from arrays and objects and put them into a variable easily. We can get many values at once in a single line. This makes the code shorter and simpler.

#### Q5. Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

Answer : Template literals in ES6 are strings written with backticks (`) instead of quotes. You can easily put variables or expressions inside them using ${}.

Unlike normal strings, you don't need (+) to join the text and variables. They also let us write text on multiple lines without using (\n). Template literals makes writing and reading strings much easier.
